2. PackageTest:  

        (1) Create a suitably named package containing a class called Series with the following static methods: nSum(int n) returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to n. The first 10 numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55.

        (2) factorial(int n) returns the product of all numbers from 1 to n i.e. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * (n - 1) * n. The first 10 factorials are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800.

        (3) fibonacci(n) returns the nth Fibonacci number. These are defined as:
              
              f(0) = 0
              f(1) = 1
              f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
         
         (so f(2) is also 1. The first 10 fibonacci numbers are:
          0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

        (4) When you have tested your functions, delete the Main class and produce a jar file.

        (5) Create a new project and add your Series library, then test the three methods in the main() method of your new project.
        
3. ScopeTest:

        (1) Write a small program to read an integer from the keyboard (using Scanner) and print out the times table for that number. The table should run from 1 to 12.

        (2) You are allowed to use one variable called scanner for your Scanner instance. You can use as many other variables as you=  need, but they must must all be called x. That includes any class instances and loop control variables that you may decide to use. If you use a class, the class can be called X (capital), but any instances of it must be called x (lower case). Any methods you create must also be called x.

        (3) Optional Extra: Change your program so that ALL variables (including the scanner instance) are called x.
